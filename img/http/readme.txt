How imgix Calculates
Usage & Pricing
$3/1000
Master Images
Only the master images you use count toward the $3/1000 master image charge. If it’s in your catalog but never requested, there’s no cost.

FREE
Unlimited Transformations
We don't charge to create different versions from your master images, so you can be as creative with the service as you desire.

8¢/GB
Optimized Content Delivery
We serve your images fast worldwide, with no additional charges for any region. Just a flat 8¢/GB of bandwidth around the globe.


What is a Master Image?
A Master Image is any image requested by imgix from your connected source (e.g. an Amazon S3 bucket). If you have previously pre-generated different versions of the same image, such as resizes and crops, you will only need to request the Master—we generate (unlimited) new rendered versions from the Master Image on the fly. We recommend the Master Image be the highest-resolution version of each of your images.

When you're in Photoshop or sketch, you get the layout you want with a click-and-drag of the mouse. In the browser you need floats and position: absolute; margin-left: -9999px; and other yuckiness.

But have you heard of flexbox? Do you know how to create and use a grid?
